% Gets quantiles for a weighted sample

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% INPUT %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% samples        -  The sample particles (that have associated weights)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% OUTPUT %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% quantile       -  The sample associated with desired quantile p.
